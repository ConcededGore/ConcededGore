Hi! I'm Silva!

I'm currently studying computer science at The university of Maine, with my main interests lying in artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

My personal project that I've been working on for a few weeks now is developing a networking application which will act as a chat room for a (currently undefined) number of users.
I plan to implement basic functionality for muting other users, as well as a fileshare system based on the passive ftp protocol! This project is teaching me the fundementals of
many concepts including socket programming, multithreading, and maintaining my fragile mental state while programming in vim! I hope to use these fundementals as a jumping off
point to many other projects involving networking with arduinos, and have already many ideas for home improvments as soon as I get my own place!

Now if only I could find a way to effeciently mine crypto currency on a smartphone...
